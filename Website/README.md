The current Website displays all the sensor Data from the ESP32 and the time when the data was updated. Google Maps also shows the exact location of the ESP32 (20-30 meters inaccuracy). Animations are used to make the website more appealing. 

For an White/Dark Mode was not enough time.
The values presented on the website are only placeholders, because NodeJs/VueJs was not implemented yet.
