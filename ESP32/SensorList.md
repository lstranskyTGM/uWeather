# Sensor List:

## KY0-18:

The KY-018 Photoresistor module is used to measure light intensity. The resistance will decrease in the presence of light and increase in the absence of it. The output is analog and determines the intensity of light.

Light intensity: lux

##  Raindrop Rain Sensor Module

Raindrop Rain Sensor Module is a module used to detect and measure rain. It usually consists of a sensor that can detect the presence of water droplets, and an electronic circuit that can process the signal from the sensor and output an indication of whether it is raining or not. 

Rain: (true/false)
